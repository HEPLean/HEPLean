# Feynman diagrams for QED

This file is currently a stub.
The aim is to include within it the Feynman rules for QED, and
calculate the results for tree-level Bhabha Scattering and Compton Scattering.

## Difficulties

The current obstacle in completing this task is the development of a general
mathematical way to encode the Feynman rules (beyond the `pre-feynman` rules).
